            <h4>1. Ordering with OnlyRoses</h4>
            <p>By placing an order with OnlyRoses, either in store, on the phone or via our website at
                www.only-roses.com (further referred to as “the website”) you are agreeing to the following terms and
                conditions.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>2. Changes to your order</h4>
            <p>If you wish to change your order, please contact us. Please note that changes to your order, such as
                change of delivery address or card message must be made at least 6 hours before the delivery is due to
                take place. This will ensure that we have time to amend the order prior to dispatch.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Once your order is being processed, cancellation of your order is possible only in exceptional
                circumstances and is entirely at our discretion. Once the product has been dispatched, orders cannot be
                cancelled anymore.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>3. Deliveries</h4>
            <p></p>
            <p>OnlyRoses offers optional delivery service in addition to any product purchase. Kindly be advised that
                delivery and product are separate items, both together can define an order, one does not affect the
                other. We always strive to fulfil any order accurately, occasional this might not be possible for
                reasons out of our control; we will always try to make good, e.g. when delivering to a workplace but the
                person is off that day, or if a delivery is rejected by the recipient for whatever, this cannot be held
                against OnlyRoses and does not entitle for any claims against us.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h5>3.1 Delivery details</h5>
            <p>We will try to ensure that your order is delivered to the recipient's address you have provided. However,
                there are times when this is not possible due to problems with the address provided or due to problems
                couriers or drivers may encounter when attempting to deliver the order. It is therefore very important
                that you ensure that the address of the recipient you provide is accurate, and that you give us
                additional instructions to assist our drivers to locate difficult-to-find addresses. We cannot be held
                responsible for non-deliveries in case of invalid or outdated delivery addresses provided by the client;
                re-deliveries in such cases are subject to an additional delivery charge.</p>
            <h5>3.2 Deliveries to offices or other commercial establishments</h5>
            <p>When delivering to offices, internal distribution stations, receptions etc we will always ask the person
                accepting the flowers to sign a proof of delivery. Upon receipt of this proof, the order is deemed to
                have been executed and OnlyRoses cannot be held liable for any delays or damages that may occur with the
                product from this point onwards.</p>
            <p>If a delivery is rejected by the recipient, the recipient is not home or not available (e.g. in
                hospital), your order will be put on hold or made available for collection at one of our stores or a
                mail deposit site. We will then contact you, and you or the recipient have the option of either
                collecting the order or arrange for a re-delivery of the order, which might be subject to an additional
                delivery charge.</p>
            <h5>3.3 Delivery Instructions</h5>
            <p>In case the sender leaves any delivery instructions (e.g. “call recipient as door bell not working), we
                will do our best to follow them and also pass this information to any service provider/courier. Once
                delivered and signed for, OnlyRoses cannot be held liable for the order from this point onwards.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h5>3.4. Deliveries and Refunds</h5>
            <p>OnlyRoses strives for 100% customer satisfaction. We are aware that sometimes items may be damaged in
                transit due to no fault of ours or the customers.</p>
            <p>In such cases, we will be offering to make the repairs ourselves, or send a small repair-kit or even a
                replacement to a customer to resolve the issue. In most cases, these work out considerably well.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, there may be certain orders that due to their complexity in crafting, logistics and/or
                their expense, a refund would not be allowed. As a result, OnlyRoses will deny any refund requests for
                any orders over $250, but always offer an option to repair or replace the damaged product.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h5>3.5 Notification period</h5>
            <p>In case an order is not received within the time as stated on the order confirmation, or arrives damages,
                please notify us within 7 days of such occurrence either by phone, email or in person in order for us to
                investigate and allow us to assist with the issue.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h5>3.6 External Courier deliveries</h5>
            <p>OnlyRoses will always ship using the chosen delivery service. Under normal circumstances the packaging
                will ensure that any order will arrive in good condition; therefore, the order might be packed or
                wrapped with additional, non-branded protective packing.</p>
            <p>OnlyRoses will not take responsibility or offer a refund for reasons out of our control, e.g. the order
                is not collected by the courier on time, could not be delivered on time or has been damaged by the
                courier company during transport. In such cases OnlyRoses will request a refund for the shipping costs
                from the courier company and pass this back to the sender for the shipping costs only.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As soon as the courier company collects the order at one of our outlets, we receive a tracking number for
                the shipment, we can provide this number to the client upon request. Please understand that from this
                point onwards we cannot be held liable for any change requests for delivery dates, change of address or
                any other change requests.</p>
            <p></p>

            <p>3.7.1 The confirmation email that is sent on completion of your order contains all the key information

            <p>3.7.2.1 for delayed/early deliver of product, depending on the service option chose by the client, we

                the client for such charges within 4 weeks.</p>
            <p>3.7.2.2 for damaged product (e.g. broken buds, damaged rose petals or any other damages), we reserve the

                of such claim incl. evidence, we will then propose to the client within latest 2 business days the best

                resulting in damages to vases, materials or structural damage to the shape or profile of an arrangement,
                we would arrange for collection of the damaged product from the recipients address and upon receipt
                produce and send out free of charge a similar product. We kindly ask the recipient in such cases to
                re-package the damaged product to her/his best knowledge prior confirming collection.</p>
            <p>3.7.2.5 In case a delay or damage to the product causes its initial purpose to pass, e.g. when the
                product has been ordered for a special occasion/date, we are happy to offer a store credit including all
                associated charges for product, delivery and postage for returning the item. Please understand that this
